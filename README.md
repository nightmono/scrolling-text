#  ⬅️🆒 Scrolling Text

Was on public transport and wanted to replicate the scrolling text displays, so I made this.

Does exactly what it says on the tin, text scrolls from left to right.

## TODO

- [x] Allow the scrolling space to be a different length than the text length (as the displays often have text that are longer or shorter than the display itself)
