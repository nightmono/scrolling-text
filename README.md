#  ‚¨ÖÔ∏èüÜí Scrolling Text

Was on public transport and wanted to replicate the scrolling text displays, so I made this.

Does exactly what it says on the tin, text scrolls from left to right.

## Usage

`python3 scrolling-text.py [text]...` no quotations marks required 

`-w` to set the width of the display (default: 32)

`-c` to center the display

`-d` to set the delay in seconds between screen updates (default: 0.1)

## TODO

- [x] Allow the scrolling space to be a different length than the text length (as the displays often have text that are longer or shorter than the display itself)
